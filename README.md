This project features a Pizza Delivery website designed to allow users to customize and place orders for pizzas. The website offers an interactive form where users can select the size of their pizza—Small, Medium, or Large—and choose from a variety of toppings. The total price is calculated dynamically based on the selected size and toppings. Once the user places an order, a success message is displayed, and the form is reset, ready for a new order. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project showcases a user-friendly interface with functional price calculation and order placement features. To use this project, simply clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and open index.html in a web browser. Contributions are welcome through forks and pull requests to enhance or add features to the project.
